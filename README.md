# Pig E. Bank Analysis
## Project Summary
This project involves an analysis of client data for Pig E. Bank, a fictional global bank. The objective of the analysis is to improve the bank's existing anti-money laundering models, identify customer behaviours that could signal money laundering activities, and identify transactions that are at high risk of money laundering. The analysis also aims to identify factors causing clients to leave the bank and ways to increase client retention. The analysis was conducted in Excel. The insights derived from the analysis will help Pig E. Bank to improve their anti-money laundering models which will ensure that the models will only flag transactions and customers that are genuinely at high risk of money laundering. The insights will also help Pig E. Bank retain clients by providing strategies to reduce client loss.
